Guide for writing test code for Unity projects.

## Rules

- Before modifying any test file, check if the editor is in Play Mode. If it is, stop it using the `unity_play_control` tool first.
- Never create `.meta` files. Unity editor creates them automatically.
- When a test creates a `GameObject` or instantiates a prefab, add `[CreateScene]` to the test method (not required if `[LoadScene]` is already present).
- When adding a test seam to production code (e.g., an `internal` accessor or a virtual override point to support injection), always wrap it with `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` … `#endif` so it is excluded from non-test builds:
    ```csharp
    #if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS
    internal void SetStateForTest(State state) => _state = state;
    #endif
    ```

### Categories

- When implementing tests designed as integration tests, add `[Category("Integration")]` to the test method.
- When implementing tests designed as visual verification tests, add `[Category("VisualVerification")]` to the test method.
- When implementing tests designed as acceptance tests (marked `(acceptance test)` in the test case design), add `[Category("Acceptance")]` to the test method.
- For test methods that test the `internal` visibility method, add `[Category("Internal")]`.
- For test methods that depend on animation timing or other timing-sensitive conditions that may cause instability on slow CPUs, add `[Category("IgnoreCI")]`.
- For test methods that specify the `GameViewResolution` attribute, add `[Category("IgnoreCI")]`.

### Multi-frame tests

When a game mechanic across frames (e.g., playing a card and waiting for its resolution), wait for the step to finish before asserting — not at a fixed frame count.

```csharp
await DragCard(Cards[1], Enemies[0]);
while (battleDirector.IsPlaying) // wait until the played action fully resolves
    await Awaitable.NextFrameAsync();
Assert.That(battleState.Enemies[0].Hp, Is.LessThan(hpBefore));
```

- To confirm step completion, use a production-side state machine or a "busy" signal (`IsPlaying`, coroutine flag, etc.). Do not use a fixed number of frames or `WaitForSeconds`.
- When UniTask is available, `UniTask.WaitUntil` and `UniTask.WaitUntilValueChanged` are alternatives to the `while` loop:
  ```csharp
  await UniTask.WaitUntil(() => isActive == false);
  await UniTask.WaitUntilValueChanged(this, x => x.isActive);
  ```
- When an operation triggers a deferred `Destroy` or UI rebuild, advance one extra `await Awaitable.NextFrameAsync()` before asserting on the new hierarchy.

### UI Tests

#### Layout assertion tests: verify UI layout with deterministic assertions

When a layout requirement is expressible as a deterministic assertion (*the element is within the screen, elements do not overlap, text does not overflow its container*), write it as a **layout assertion test** (an integration test), not a visual verification test. Displayed content (card data, text length, item count) is a test *input*: the pass criterion never varies with it. Leave to visual verification what does not suit a strict assertion: color, positional relationships like "A is to the right of B", on-screen position, and typography (font size, font style, font family) are design intent likely to change, and legibility (text/background contrast) is impractical to assert.
Reasons:

- **Deterministic pass/fail**: boolean assertions run unattended in CI without a human reading screenshots.
- **Pins the specific bug**: an overlap assertion names the two elements; a screenshot cannot.
- **Do NOT add a visual verification test for the same property** — verify each layout property in exactly one layer.

Choose the implementation means by what the condition is about:

- **Rect comparison** — `Is.WithinScreen` (within-screen bounds), `Is.FullyWithin(container)` (containment in a parent), `Is.Not.Overlapping` (overlap between elements)
- **Text overflow** — `Is.Not.TextOverflowing` (preferred/rendered size exceeds the rect, or characters are truncated)
- **Raycast reachability** — `GameObjectFinder` with `reachable: true` (optionally with a paginator) proves the element is on screen and not covered by another element; use it when the condition is "the user can actually reach this element"

Before asserting, settle layout with `Canvas.ForceUpdateCanvases()` then `await Awaitable.NextFrameAsync()` — the former rebuilds pending layout/graphic geometry (rect sizes, text metrics); the latter waits for a real render pass, which is what a raycast reachability check needs, since a newly activated/deactivated `Graphic`'s `CanvasRenderer.depth` stays unset until then and `GraphicRaycaster` silently skips any candidate whose `depth == -1` — `ForceUpdateCanvases()` alone does not assign it.

See `test-helper.md` → **Layout constraints** for the constraint API (`Is.WithinScreen` / `Is.FullyWithin` / `Is.Not.Overlapping` / `Is.Not.TextOverflowing`).

#### Use GameObjectFinder instead of GameObject.Find

When finding a GameObject that the user interacts with, always use `TestHelper.UI.GameObjectFinder` instead of `UnityEngine.GameObject.Find`, `Object.FindFirstObjectByType`, `Object.FindAnyObjectByType`, and `Object.FindObjectOfType`.
Reasons:

- **Timing safety**: polls until the object appears, so tests pass even when GameObjects are instantiated asynchronously or on the next frame
- **Reachability and interactability**: verifies the object is actually reachable by the user and (optionally) interactable — matching real user experience
- **Blocking check**: `reachable: true` (default) naturally catches elements hidden behind a modal or overlay — which is often the bug being caught
- **Actionable failures**: throws `TimeoutException` with a clear message; `GameObject.Find` silently returns `null` and causes a confusing `NullReferenceException` later

#### Use Operators instead of direct event invocation

When reproducing user actions, always use uGUI operators (e.g., `UguiClickOperator`, `UguiTextInputOperator` in `TestHelper.UI.Operators` namespace) instead of directly calling button events or setting field values.
Reasons:

- **Correct event simulation**: operators go through Unity's `EventSystem` and input pipeline, exercising the same code path as a real user interaction
- **Reachability-gated**: test fails if a UI element is disabled or hidden
- **Simpler test code**: no need to look up components or call internal methods; just find the GameObject and operate it

```csharp
// NG — bypasses Unity's event pipeline
button.GetComponent<Button>().onClick.Invoke();
inputField.GetComponent<InputField>().text = "12345";
scene.OnConfirmClicked();

// OK — goes through the proper UI event path
await new UguiClickOperator().OperateAsync(button);
await new UguiTextInputOperator().OperateAsync(inputField, "12345");
```

#### Verify modal/overlay blocking

A modal or overlay must block interaction with elements behind it. Test from two angles:

- **Behavioural (preferred)**: attempt to reach a background element via `GameObjectFinder` with `reachable: true` (default) while the overlay is open — the finder throws `TimeoutException`, confirming blockage. Repeat with the overlay dismissed to confirm reachability restores.
- **Structural**: assert the backdrop intercepts raycasts: `Assert.That(background.GetComponent<Image>().raycastTarget, Is.True)` (or `canvasGroup.blocksRaycasts`).

When a decorative full-screen element should not block (e.g., a background image), annotate it with `NonBlockingAnnotation` so `GameObjectFinder` skips it (see `test-helper-ui.md`).

### Visual verification tests

When implementing a visual verification test (a test designed to verify on-screen rendering via screenshot and image analysis):

1. Take a screenshot using `[TakeScreenshot]` or `ScreenshotHelper.TakeScreenshotAsync()` (see `test-helper.md`).
2. Add `[Description("After running this test, verify the screenshots from the following perspectives: <verification aspects>")]` to the test method. The verification aspects are taken directly from the **Image analysis by saved screenshot** column in the test case design. List only aspects suited to visual verification (legibility, contrast, positional relationships, typography, visual state representation, rendering quality) — do NOT list mechanically assertable facts such as a panel's `activeSelf` or exact text content; assert those in integration tests instead.
3. Add `[Category("VisualVerification")]` to the test method.
4. You can omit writing `Assert` statements.

When a designed visual verification test shares its test condition with a designed layout assertion test, you may implement both as a single test method: take the screenshot in the layout assertion test, apply steps 2–3 to it, and keep the layout assertions (step 4 does not apply).

## Resources

Read the appropriate resource file based on the situation:

- Before writing or modifying any test code file: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/unity-test-framework.md`
- Before writing or modifying any test code file: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/test-helper.md`
- Before writing or modifying UI tests with `TestHelper.UI` namespace API (e.g., `GameObjectFinder`, `Monkey`): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/test-helper-ui.md`
- Before writing or modifying performance tests (`com.unity.test-framework.performance`, `[Performance]`, `Measure.*`): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/unity-test-framework-performance.md`
